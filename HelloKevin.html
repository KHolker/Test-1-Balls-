    <p>Good job with that web page.  I've never tried the button with the dropdown list.  That was the javascript at the bottom, right?</p>
    <p>Just for fun, I added a folder to the project and I'm adding a picture from one of the dropdown results.</p>
    <p>Take a look at how the navigation worked with the 'a' tag, both on your page and at the end of this page.</p>
    <h4>Critique:</h4>
    <p>I noticed your 'head' tag is has body markup above it, which is not what you'd normally see.  Seems to work alright, but it makes the code hard to read.
        You have two styles defined, one at the top and one in the head section.  That's ok too, but one of them takes precedence in the event that there
        are conflicting instructions.  I'm not sure how that precedence works, though.
